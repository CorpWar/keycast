[![Build Status](http://90.230.165.227:7890/buildStatus/icon?job=CorpWar KeyCast)](http://90.230.165.227:7890/job/CorpWar%20KeyCast/)

Keycast are a java open-source keystroke visualizer that display what buttons you are pressing. This can be very good when you want to display your keystroke while recording screencasts. I hope this work for all OS but I have problem to test it. So if someone want to test it on other then Windows I would be happy.

## Run application
You can just [download the jar](https://github.com/CorpWar/keycast/releases/download/v0.98/corpwar-keycast-all-0.98.jar) and run it. So just head over to [Release section](https://github.com/CorpWar/keycast/releases) and download the latest JAR file or use the other link. After you download it you should be able to just run it. If you find any bugs or have idés for improvments just write an issue.

## Source
If you have other idés then just fork the source and make something fun out of it. It is all open source.
